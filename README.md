# House_Prices_Project
House Prices project from Kaggle. I used this code as a guideline: https://www.kaggle.com/serigne/stacked-regressions-top-4-on-leaderboard. Thanks a lot to Serigne. I used model stacking with various regression models to achieve quite good prediction results. This is not the final version, there are updates and improvements coming in the future!
